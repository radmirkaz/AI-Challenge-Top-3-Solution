### Step 1: Cloning repository

Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radmirkaz/AI-Challenge-Top-3-Solution.git
```

### Step 2: Installing dependencies

Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your project. Then run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Launching the Streamlit application

Now that all dependencies are installed, you can launch the Streamlit application using the following command:

```bash
cd streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 4: Opening an application in a browser

After running the previous command, you will see a URL in the console where you can open the Streamlit application. Typically this will be `http://localhost:8501`. Open your browser and visit this URL to interact with your application.

Ready! The Streamlit application should be successfully installed and launched.
